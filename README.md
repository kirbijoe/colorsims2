# colorsims2

ColorSims 2.0 is an extension to the existing python package ColorSims (https://www.imbs.uci.edu/research/MBS15-01.pdf) which includes notable updates and additions to the original package. ColorSims 2.0 is a python package for simulating the cultural evolution of linguistic color naming conventions. The package can be initialized with random agents or population data (i.e. World Color Survey). The components of the package are modular, allowing the user to vary them independently. Implemented parameters include: dimensions of the color space, population size, and agent learning mechanisms (i.e. reinforcement learning, updating) within the evolutionary dynamics in addition to on-board utilities for storing data and visualizing simulation results.

Simulations can be executed from demo.py. This package is compatible with Python3.
